# Nix Format

Why am I creating this project?
 - there is a HUGE need within the nix ecosystem
    - auto format commits
    - automate syntax discussions for PR reviews
    - reorder attributes (alphabetize packages)
 - want to learn the difference between concrete syntax trees and
   traditional synax trees that a compute uses

# Dependencies

 - [sly](https://github.com/dabeaz/sly) lex/yacc for python
